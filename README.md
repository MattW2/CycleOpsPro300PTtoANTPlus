# CycleOpsPro300PTtoANTPlus
Read in the raw data from the CycleOps Pro 300PT Indoor Cycle wheel and output it as a ANT+ signal using an Arduino and Nordic nRF24AP

## Background
I got a really good deal on Craigslist on this indoor bike. I had also recently become addicted to Zwift and really wanted to be able to use this with Zwift rather than use my bike on a trainer. The included computer refused to save data past about 10 minutes making it all but worthless for saving training sessions. As I find time I'll be documenting the reverse engineering and build at [https://blinkyme.000webhostapp.com/category/cycleops-pro300pt-to-ant/](https://blinkyme.000webhostapp.com/category/cycleops-pro300pt-to-ant/) see website for project details
